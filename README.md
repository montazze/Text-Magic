## Features

### Split text to layers

You can select a text layer and create a new layer for each line. Pretty useful to split a list of items you pasted in one shot.

![Select a text layer, click Plugins, Text Magic, Split text to layers](docs/split-text-to-layers.gif?raw=true)

Empty lines are ignored when splitting so no empty layer will be created.

#### Known limitations

* When splitting lines, the first line's style will be applied to every created layer
